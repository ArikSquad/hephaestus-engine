## Model Limitations

Using the vanilla Minecraft client, we have the following
limitations when creating models:

- Bone cubes cannot be larger than `128x128x128` units, 
where `16` units are equal to the size of a Minecraft block
- Bone cube rotations can only be `-45º`, `-22.5º`, `0º`,
`22.5º` or `45º`, however, this does not apply to bone
rotations
